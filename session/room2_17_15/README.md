**Room:** Room 2 (Rome)

**Start Time:** 2024-06-21 17:15

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the Zero Trust model stands out as a paradigm shift towards more dynamic and granular security measures. This presentation delves into the principles of Zero Trust architecture and its practical implementation in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environments, leveraging the new Istio service mesh add-on for enhanced security. We will explore the methodologies for establishing a Zero Trust framework, focusing on user and device authentication, authorization, and continuous verification. By integrating Zero Trust with AKS and Istio, organizations can create a robust defense mechanism that adapts to the complexities of modern infrastructure and the ever-changing threat landscape.
