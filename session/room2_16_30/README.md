# Demystifying the complexity of a Zone Redundant AKS deployment for achieving top class resiliency
**Room:** Room 2 (Rome)

**Start Time:** 2024-06-21 16:30

In todayâ€™s cloud application landscape, resilience is paramount. When failures strike, a robust solution ensures rapid recovery and sustained functionality. When dealing with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters, intra-region resiliency gains prominence through zone redundancy. 

This session explores the creation of zone-redundant AKS clusters in Microsoft Azure and delves into the implications of each approach on deployment strategies and configuration of persistent volumes for workloads. Join us to fortify your AKS infrastructure and elevate your application resilience in the Azure cloud!
